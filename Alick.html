            Personal Profile
        </h2>
        <p>
        I am a competent and committed Chemical Engineering graduate of Lagos State Polytechnic. During my degree, I created social media platforms to keep my colleagues and other students abreast with information and recent happenings regarding my department and the school. As a result, I was invited to join my school's IT department.

        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>
            As a graduate, my communication skills have been greatly enhanced in impacting knowledge and disseminating information. I was a member of a team that helped Jambites and new students with information, procedures and registration requirements into the Engineering faculty. This development contributed to the fast and easy admission of students into their respective levels as all documentation were readily available.

        <p>
            I possess the ability to work well in a team because I understand that teams are put together to achieve a common goal and success depends on the positive synergy between the team members. I also love to learn from other members of the team.
